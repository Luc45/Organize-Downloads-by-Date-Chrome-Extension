# Organize Downloads by Date - Chrome Extension

This is a very simple extension, it automatically organizes your downloads by date, like so:
**Before**: Downloads/example.file
**After**: Downloads/**2018/10**/example.file


# Installation

 1. [Download the extension](https://github.com/Luc45/Organize-Downloads-by-Date-Chrome-Extension/archive/master.zip)
 2. Extract to a folder of your choice
 3. Open Chrome -> Extensions -> Enable Developer Mode
 4. Click on "Load unpacked" and point to the folder of step 2
 5. That's it!

I didn't release this as an official extension because Google charges a 5 dollars fee.
Please do not release this extension without my consent.
